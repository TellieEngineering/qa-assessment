# Tellie's QA Assessment

**_[Estimated completion time: ~45 minutes]_**

Hello and welcome to Tellie&#39;s QA assessment! ðŸ‘‹

This will test your ability to catch visual and behavioral test case failures in real-world components. Tellie is a visually rich application, so our quality bar for aesthetics and user experience is high!

Today, we want you to assure the quality of our Add/Edit Tiles component ([storybook](https://tellieengineering.github.io/qa-assessment/?path=/story/composed-ui-library-set-editor-tiles--interactive) / [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/PbmqwQVTBul7CnqlRDdDC5/QA-Assessment-Design-Guide?node-id=2%3A4474)).

Tellie uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to bridge our design and development teams. You will find a link to the component in their respective applications above. There are more stories in our storybook (feel free to explore!), but please only test the specific story above (**one** **total**). Also, please also review our fonts and color scheme [here](https://www.figma.com/file/PbmqwQVTBul7CnqlRDdDC5/QA-Assessment-Design-Guide?node-id=2%3A355).

Here's a [video](https://github.com/TellieEngineering/qa-assessment/raw/main/qa_overview.mp4) overview of how to use Figma and Storybook.

We have purposefully introduced bugs/errors into the component above. Review the Acceptance Criteria below and manually test the component against the criteria in Chrome on Desktop (you might opt to test other browsers, but this is not required).

## Add/Edit Tiles Interactive - Acceptance Criteria

Tellie provides &quot;Tiles&quot; to users. Tiles are the main primitive with which users build their sites. There are several different Tile types, from Tiles that display an image, that display a set of links, that play media, etc. This component manages what Tiles appear on a user&#39;s site (and in what order on Mobile).

- Must match designs exactly (pixel perfect colors, spacing, fonts, etc.)
- Clicking Add Tile should show a popup with three Tile types: Image, Links, and Shop
- Clicking an item in the Add Tile popup should add that Tile type to the Tile list below
- User should not be able to add more than 10 Tiles
- Should show delete modal to confirm deleting a tile
- Message should appear when a Tile is deleted explaining the deletion and disappear after 5 seconds
- Message should appear when the max Tile limit is reached
- Tiles are ordered and dragging a Tile should reorder the Tiles
- User should be able to delete a Tile by clicking the small down arrow on the right of each Tile item and clicking &quot;Delete&quot;
- Text should be selectable

# What to send us

Create a shareable online document (Google Docs, etc) and provide us a completed test plan with specific examples (where the UI/behavior differs, etc.) and test case for the component. Please also include any items you found in exploratory testing, such as odd behaviors that you would expect to work differently. 

Email the document to `engineering@tell.ie` and title it `<Your Name> - QA Submission`. Also include answers to the following (500 words max for each answer):

1. What tools did you use to validate the acceptance criteria?
1. What steps would you take to eliminate future regressions?
1. How would you approach the e2e testing of these components once they graduate to the application?
1. What other questions might you have about the components?

Feel free to reach out with any questions to the same email. Good luck and thank you!
